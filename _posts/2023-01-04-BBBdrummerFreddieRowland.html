<p>Bang Bang Bunny’s drummer Freddie Rowland, who is in Love Dogz with Big Brother Winner Pete Bennett and Mad Dog
    Collective says that he is really excited to be in a punk-rap band fronted by an amazing female artist. “I met
    Madaldn in 2022, and I saw something different and worth investing in. Some people might be put off by the fact that
    Madaldn is a single mum of two, but I love a MILF. Jokes aside, it isn’t easy as we all live so far apart and have
    to work within school hours. But we make it happen.”</p>
