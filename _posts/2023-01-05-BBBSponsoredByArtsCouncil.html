<p>Bang Bang Bunny are sponsored by The Arts Council England and were awarded the DYCP Grant in 2023 to fuse punk rap
    with Scottish Gaelic, to popularise an endangered language and history through music. Madaldn, born in Essex,
    descends from the Elliott Clan. She States “My grandad tells me how his grandad fought in Black Watch, a feared
    Scottish army battalion, known for their fierce tempers. I’m going to bring that ferocity and culture to my music.“
