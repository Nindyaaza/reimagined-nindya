<p><a href="https://theforestsounds.com/">The Forest Sounds – Music for Everyone</a> – an organisation that seeks to
    deliver music production projects across the U.K in order to close the horrendous gender gap in music production.
    Madaldn founded this project when she struggled to work with the multitude of male music producers out there, who
    had their own agendas, and decided to teach herself music production and enable other under represented groups in
    music production to do so too.</p>
