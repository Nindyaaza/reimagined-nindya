<p>Where there is rage, rhymes and very little money you will find Punk Rap Band- Bang Bang Bunny. With working class
    underground rapper, Madaldn on Lead guitar, LoVe DoGz' rhythm section, a few frilly reprobates from Mad Dog
    Collective, and managed by Hollywood star David Lovgren, this band puts the best of punk-rap, north, south and a
    little bit west, together. A bit grungy, very grimy and gorgeously gritty.</p>
<p>To date, Bang Bang Bunny have performed at venues all across the U.K, smashed up some main stages from
    BoomTown to Small World and appeared on Resonance, Manchester and Soho Radio in 2022. Madaldn states, “We have a
    number of amazing shows coming up in Bristol, London and Brighton. We are currently working on two albums, an E.P
    and directing and editing the video for OUR FIRST official release.“ Their E.P (SpringBoard), is set to be released-
    March 2023 for distribution across all major platforms.
